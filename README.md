# brow-evidence-pack-template

**A reusable structural template for AI governance evidence packs.**

This repository provides a **documentation framework only** — designed to be copied and populated with organisation-specific evidence for:

- ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management Systems
- GDPR Article 22 automated decision assurance
- Model Risk Management and Responsible AI reviews
  
## Contents
- [How to use](#how-this-template-is-intended-to-be-used)
- [Template structure](#template-structure)
- [What to customise first](#what-to-customise-first)
- [Status](#status)

> **Important**
> - This is a **template repository**.
> - It contains **no real model outputs, no datasets, and no audit conclusions**.

## How this template is intended to be used

1. Clone or fork this repository  
2. Keep folder names and document structure unchanged  
3. Populate each section with your own:
   - policies
   - risk assessments
   - model evidence
   - explainability outputs
   - fairness results
4. Export a compiled evidence pack for internal review or audit

This structure is deliberately **tool-agnostic** and **sector-neutral**.
